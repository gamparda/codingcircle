# Cat War server

The dedicated server uses the same authoritative Godot code and executable as the client.

Run from PowerShell after exporting the project:

```powershell
.\builds\CatWar.exe --headless -- --server --port=7777
```

On an installed copy, launch **Cat War Dedicated Server** from the Start menu or run `StartServer.cmd`. The server listens on UDP. Open the selected UDP port in the host firewall and cloud security group/router as required.

## Production Linux server

The official Linux service runs Godot headlessly under `catwar-server.service`. Install
`server/linux/catwar-update.service` and `server/linux/catwar-update.timer` to poll the
tested GitHub Pages update manifest every two minutes. An update is staged and tested
first. The live server then stops accepting new players, waits for active matches to
finish, swaps the application tree, and restarts. A failed readiness check rolls back to
the previous tree.

The service must set `CATWAR_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/catwar` and grant its unprivileged user
write access to that directory. The updater itself runs as a root oneshot because it
atomically replaces the root-owned application tree and controls the game service.
